272. The characteristic of the second conjugation is e. This e does not
· unite with the ending -ὅ aethe eof the first coniugaticn does. Otherwisea
simple substitution of ὁ for the stem vowel d makes the only difference
between the tenses based 01'1 the present stem (see 264) in the second conju-
gation and the same tenses in the first conjugation.

The infinitive ends in -ere When this is given in the principal parts the
verb is known to be of the second conjugation.

273. The perfect stem is usually formed by substituting u for the final
vowel of the present stem3 asin moneo, I ware: present stem, mone,
perfect stem, monu·. But thiais not true of all words ; therefore the prin-
cipal parts must be learned ao well that they will come to mind without
effort. In all verbs of all conjugatione the tenses based on the perfect stem
(see 265) are formed exactly as in laudo.
