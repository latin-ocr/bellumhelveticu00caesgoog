2³0. Oharaoterizing clauses, like result clauses (226), eontain
sometimes the contingent future subjunctive (184, t), but usually the
subjunctive of fact (184, ct. They are, however, introduced by arelative
instead of by ut. Some oi them approach very nearly to result clauses
in meaning and are usually called result clauses.

Itis difficult, but important, to distinguish them from some other
relative clauses, which contain the indicative. The following points
distinguishthem: (1) They are used to tell what aaa oi a person or
thing the antecedent is. 'thiedistinguishes them from 231. (2) The
antecedent must be tadcy‘inite, or lmomplete in deols, so that the relative
clause is necessary to make complete sense. This distinguishes them
from the clauses in 232, which may also tell what kind oi a person or
thing the antecedent is. (3) The antecedent must nothe a universal

indefinite (like every one, alcyone), which includes all of a class marked ἦ

outhy a relative clause. This distinguishes them from the relative
conditional clauses (250). ’

Characterizing clauses are used especially after such expressions ae
