indicate which is subject and which is obiect, and that these iorms are called
cases. There are, in all, six cases, each of which shows a different relation
ιο other words in a sentence. Most oi these relations can be expressed in
English only by the' use of such prepositions as os, to, from, by, etc. Exam-

57. Latin nouns are inflected in five deciensions, distinguished from one
another by the final letter (characteristic) oi their stems‚ and by the termi-
nation ci the genitive singular. In the vocabularies the termination of the
genitive singular is given aiter the nominative, and the deciension thus
readily and certainly made known. In those noune which have only plural
forms, the ending of the genitive plural is placed aiter the nominative form.

58. In the first deciension the stem vowel, or characteristic, is fi; the
genitive singular ends in -ae. From the characteristic vowel a, this is some-
times called the a deciension. =
