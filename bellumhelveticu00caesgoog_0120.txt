355. The subjunctive has only four tenses-present, imperfect, per·
fect, and pluperfect. Of these the present and imperfect are formed on the
present stem. The present subjunctive is formed by changlng the final
vowel of the present stem, or by adding fr to the present stem, and adding
the personal endings (263 and 314); as lauda, laude, present subjunc- ,
tive, laudem. The imperfect subjunctive is formed by adding re to the

unchanged present stem, and to this the personsl endings ; as, lauda· ψτό,
imperfect subjunctive, laudarem.
