NOTES

294. biennium sibl satis esee duxerunt: duxerunt has here its
less usual meaning oi taccu. A verb meaning to thiale has been used
before, followed by the infinitiva (see 2³4 and 241). Biennium is the
accusative, subiect oi esee. Satis is apredicate adjective. The literal

meaning is thought two years to be enoaplsor themselves. Translate, thoeplrt
that two years were enouphsor them.

295. in tertium annum: translate, sor the third year.

296. confirmant: notice that although this is a present tense it is
used of past time. This is called the historiccl present. In English a
present is sometimes used in the same way, but not nearly as often as in
Latin. It is, therefore, better to translate by apast tense.

299. ΤΗΕ aertextve PRONOUN

A reflexive pronoun is one which refers to the subiect, as himself in lte
prateae himself. In the third person Latin has a special pronoun ior this
purpose. As this pronoun can neither be the subject oi a finite verb nor
agree with such a subject, it can never be a nominative or a vocative, so
these cases are lacking. (Himsels in lle himself praiaco ltim is quite another
word in Latin, ior it only emphasizes le ; it would be nominative.) As the
reflexive pronoun refers to the subject one can always be sure oi its number
and gender‚ so that the same forms are used ior both numbers and all geu·
ders. Examples: hemo se laudat, tlte mon protam limacls; mulier ee
laudat, ilc woman pruinas herself ; Galli se laudant, tlte Gaula praec
thenaelvea.
