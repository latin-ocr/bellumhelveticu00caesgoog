express past time (compare the use oi tenses in 221, h). Examples: si
fortis esset eum laudarem, iste were hove Ι should wahe, or be probino,
him (implyinghutheisnol, andI donol); nisiprb patria pugnavisset
eum non nudavissem, uidae lte hod (if he hod nol) souphtsor tis country I

o. When tbe conclusion oi such conditione containsa verb meaning
could or copti, or such expressions as il would be bord, or joui, tbe verb is
usually in the indicative, the imperfect ior present time, the perfect or
pluperiect for past time. 'l'be condition inquires the subjunctive, like
any other condition contrary to ieet. 'l'his is because the conclusion is
not usually really contrary to laet, though the English idiom makes it
seem sc. When tbe conclusion is really contrary to lact, the subjunc-
tive is used. Examples: si fortis esset pi'agnare poteret, rste cerebrove
te could fipht (he has the power in any case; hence the indicative); ai
fortis fuisset pugnare debiut or debuerat, is he hod been broce lze ouyhl
io'bcoefocyld (the duty rested upon him in any case; hence the indica·
tive).

no form to express noniulfillment, and could be none, since one can not
be sure oi a noniulfillment of a future condition.

250. More confident (virid) future This is expressed in Latin by
the future or future perfect indicative in both clauses. The English may
mislead; for, though it uses the future in tbe conclusion, it commonly
uses the present with a future meaning in the condition. Is I see him I

eise in using the future. Moreover, ii the condition must be fulfilled
before the conclusion can take place, the Latin uses the future perfect,
while the English commonly uses the present, or, at most, the perfect.
Iflle antiocafirsl hc erili tell litun, means iflre sliall licre arrived first, and the
Latin is precise in using the future perfect. Examples: si pugnabit
