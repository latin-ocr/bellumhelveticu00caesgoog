197. ln telling of past events the indicative tenses used are the his·
torical perfect (or the equivalent historical present), the imperfect, the
pluperfect, and occasionally the imperfect periphrastic. The perfect is
the narrating tense in which the successive main events of the story are

told. The other tenses are the descriptive tenses in which the details κ

which surround the main events are told, See 189.

For example, suppose one wished to begin a story with the following
points. “The Helvetians lived in a small country; they planned to
leave; Caesar wentto GaulJ’ Told in that way all the verbs would be
periects; but the story is badly told. One would certainly pick out
some chief event or events and group the others about them; and what·
ever events he so picked out would be expressed by the perfect, while
therest wouldbe imperfect and pluperfect. He might begin in this
way, “The Helvetians‚ who lived .......... planned .......... But Caesar
went .......... ” Thenplonnedand went are perfecta, each. being thought
of as a separate step in the story ς but lived is thought oi as a subordinate
