519. consulem: scc 160. Helvetiis: sce 320. animb: see 468.
facultate: see ³44.

520. Memoria tenere, toremeraber, is equivalent in meaning to averb
of thinking, and is followed by the accusative and infinitiva.

521. Esse is very often omitted in the future active and perfect passive

infinitives. Here it is to be supplied with occisum, pulsum, missum,
and temperfitsrrbs. ’

522. t. cassium: Lucius Cassius Longinus consul in 107 ac, and
slain in battle by the Tigurini, a part of the Helvetii.

523. subiugum missum: two spears were set upright in the ground

and a third fastened across their tops. A defeated army was made to march
under this in token of submissior.

524. Sub governs its cases on the same principle asin. See App. 154.

525. concedendum: supply esse. The gerundive with some form
of the verb sum, expressed or understood, is used in Latin to express neces-
sity or obligation. This is generally rendered by the use of the auxiliaries
maa or ouant. Thus concedendum nbn putabat, he did aot thiale it tuce
to be aranee or euplii io be granted. This forms what is called the second,
or passive, periphrastic conJ'ugation. Compare 414. f

526. faciundi: another form of the gerundive. See 409.

527. Notice that the imperfect is used in the principal verbs here (see
³49), because these sentences describe the condition of things under which
Caesar gave the reply in the next sentence.
