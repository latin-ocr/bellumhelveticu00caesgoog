Review what was said of the imperfect and perfect in 226. Now read
over Chapter HI· and notice the indicative tenses, for they are typical of
Caesar’s general usage. Notioe that in every sentence the principal verb
tells a new point in the story and is a perfect or the equivalent historical
present. The dependent clauses do not tell new points in the story, but
either tell of something that had happened before the time of the principal
verb (pluperfect tense) or describe something as going on or existing at the «
time of the prinoipal verb (imperfect tense). rtey determined-thcyde-
eldad-they set the dete-Orpetoric was chorea-be accepted-he per-
suaded: all these are perfecte or presents. But now in a subordinate clause
it is learned that before this tirhe some one hod held—hod bean called (plu-
perfects). Again in the historical present Orgetorix penades, and in a sub-
ordinate clause it is learned that at that time some one was tn power - was
decr (imperfecte).

No fixed rule can be given. The tenses are always used to express the
shalle of meaning wanted. But this is a good principle to work on: in
dealing with past time, unless the meaning clearly calls for some other tense,
