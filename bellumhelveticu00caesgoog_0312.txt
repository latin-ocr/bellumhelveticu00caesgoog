TENSES OF ΙΝῐ-ἸΝΙΤΙνΕὸ aab saavlctstes

205. Infinitives and participles can not be used asindependent verbs
(but see 281). They take their time from the verb on which they depend,
and express only the stage of progrers of the act (see les), and therefore
do not need forms enough to express all the tenses. That is, a present
infinitiva or participle expresses action as going on at the time of tae
main verb, whether that is present, future, or past3 afutura expresses
action as future to the time of the main verb; and a perfect expresses
action as completed at the time of the main verb. The following table
gives examplcs of the infinitiva. Δ The tense meanings of the participles
are the same.

paradigms is rarely used. In both cases the place of the future
infinitive is taken by fore (futdrum esse) ut, a would bc that, with the
present or imperfect subjunctive. Examples: dicit fore ut timeatis
saps thalla salissam dixit fors ut laudaretur, de said that te waald bc
