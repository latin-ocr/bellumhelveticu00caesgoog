lMPERFEOT TENSE

226. It has been seen that the perfect expresses simply a past act or
state. The imperfect is also a past tense. but besides telling that the act
or state was past, it also tells that it was still poinp on at the past time. For
example : laudavit means he praised5 it simply tells a past fact : laudabat
means lte was pratea,- it tells that the act is past, and also that it was still
going 011 at the past time one is thinking about. Sometimes laudabat
must be translated by he praised, because English is not as precise in the use
oi tenses as Latin is.

227. The first conjugation forms the imperfect indicative active by add-
ing -ba- to 'the present stem, as a tense-sign, and using the same endings as
in the present, except that the first person ends in -ω,

2, laudabas you were praising laudabatie you werepraising
3. laudabat he was praising laudabant they were praising

228. The imperfect oi the verb to be uses the same endings, but a differ-
ent tense-sign.

3. erat hc was erant they were

Notice that the meanings given are the same as ior the perfect (see 1⁷³) ᾗ
but the distinction given in 226 holds good iu Latin.
