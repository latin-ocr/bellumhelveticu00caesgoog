rayca : The text is treated afourth time inquestione in Latin
to be answered in Latin by the student. These questions pro
mote that mastery of the language which is to be attained only
by its use in this way. They are suggestive, and the toacher
can vary them and increase their number at pleasure.

Sintia: Paradigrns of deciensions and conjugatione and the
‘principles of syntax are introduced gradually, after tho student

has acquired words and sentences illustrating these forms and
principles. The book is complete without a grammar. Each
principle is explained but once, and when illustratione of the
same fact appear reference is made by figures to the first
example and explanation. The explanatione of the text and of
many grammatica] principles are given in notes in connection
urith each lesson. These notes are to be carefully learned and
'recited, to insure thoroughnoss and prevent waste of time in
frequently referring to the same subject.

In the rev'ised form many Latin-English exercises have been
inserted. The amount of text in each lesson is necessarily very
small at first, and not sufficient to give a proper drill in trans·
lating Latin. On the other hand the English-Latin exercises
have been shortened, simplified, or rewritten. Some of the new
exercises are merely for drill on forms or points of syntax.
Some are intended for oral work, some for written, though no
separate headings are given to indicate their purpose.

An especial effort has been made to simplify the early lessons
and to lead the student on by steps of very gradually increasing
difficulty. With this object in view the early lassans have been

· shortened and the paradigma have been presented much more

gradually, in a changed order, and spread out over more lassons.
Many review lessons have been given, perhaps more than
some teaohers need. If this should be the case two can be corn-
¹ bined very easily3 or some may even be omitted, since no new
principles are given in them. But the reviset would prefer still
more rather than less.
The Latin questions in the original book included questions
