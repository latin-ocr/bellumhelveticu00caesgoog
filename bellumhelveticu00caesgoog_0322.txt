is always used. For past time the perfect or historical present is always
used, although English is apt to use the pluperfect. See 198, c, 1. The
conjunctione are postquam, estem ut, ubi, anm (in the sense of after, not
in the sense of rutilet· simul nc, cum primum, caseon as (irnraedrut’lyasta).
(Cum with the pluperfect subjunctive has the same meaning.) Example:
ubi certiores facti sunt, legates mittunt (Caes. 1, 7, 7), when they aare
informen of it iimperat eineys. '

Ciam

238. 011111, aalma, is a relative adverb or conjunction, as is shown by
its original form quom. The use of modes with it is much the same as
with the declined relative. Its antecedent is a word of time, sometimes
expressed, usually understood, in the principa] clause. Besldes the
meaning aalma, it has taken on the meanings sirice (causei) and ellltoayb
(adversative). ,

239. Causal and adversative cum is used with the subjunctive of all
tenses. Compare the causal relative (2411) and adversative relative (247).
Examples: quae eumita sint, perge (Cic. Cat. I, 10), aiace thiais ao, poen,-
his cum persutdere n6n possent, legatos mittunt (Caes. I, 9, 3), anco
they could aot persuade thera they sent caenys: oum ad vesperum
pugnatum sit (Caes. I, 26, 5), although they souyht till maniae.

240. An insecutam, but convenient, statement for temporal eum
(aalma) is as follows: tempora} cum is generally used with the subjunctive
of the imperfect and pluperfect tenses when the principal verb is past,
always with the indicative of the other tenses when the principal verb
is present or future. See examplos under 241 and 242, which give
more accurate statements for the samo clauses.

241.1ndicativeclauses. Tho indicative is used with tempora]
cum in the following clauses:

a. aaran of daie. These are used strictly to tell relect time (not
mitat kind of time), and conespond eyactly to determining relative
clauses (231). (Buta subjunctive is often found where an indicative
might be expected.) Exemplo: cum Caesar in Galliam 1611111111-
cipes erant Aedui (Caes. VI, 12, 1), at the time when Caeam came to Gaul
tlte Aedui uere tlte leaders. Compare cum esset (Caes. II, 1,1) which
seems almost the same thought.

b. Generaliziap (conditional) clausa. In those cum means ainana.
They correspond exactiy to conditional relative clauses (250). (The =
subjunctive is sometimes used in them. See 242, b.) Example: haee
