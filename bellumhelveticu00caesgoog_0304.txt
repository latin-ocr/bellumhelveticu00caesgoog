tivo sentences (except with no), or questions implying a negative, to

probe augona· num quemquam laudo, I do not protae copone, do I?

THE 'VERE

ΑθκεεΜεΝτ os venenuo suaoecr ‘ .

179. Ii there is but one subiect, the finite verb agrees with it in
person and number, and in the compound tenses the participle agrees
with it in gender. Examples: Caesar laudatus est, &aaarwmprolsem
mulieres laudatae sunt, the women arere praised.

a But the verb sometimes agrees with the meaning oi the subiect
, rather than its grammatical torm. Thus a singular collective noun
sometimes has a plural verb, and a neuter noun a masculine participle
in agreement. Examples: multitudo venerunt, o preat number coma·
duo milia occisi sunt, two thousand were killed.

180. Ifthere are two or more subjecta, the verb is usually plural,
and in the compound tenses ol the passive 'the participle follows the
rule given ior predicate adjectives (157, o, 2). 1f the subiecta differ in
person the first person is preferred to the second and the second to the
third. Examples: homo et mulier occisi sunt, the mun ond lle woman
were killed· ego et tri venimus, you aod I come.

o. The verb may agree with the nearest subiect, especially if the
verb stands first or after the first subiect. It regularly does so ii the
subiectsare connected by coniunctions meaning or or nor. ’ Examplea
