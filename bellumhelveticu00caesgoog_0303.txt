173. Α relative pronoun agrees in gender and number with its
antecedent3 its case depende on its construction in the clause in which
it stands. If it is used as'subject the verb agrees in person with the
antecedent. If the relative has two or more antecedents it follows the
same rules of agreement as predicate adJectives (lanu, 2). The relative
is never omitted Examples: caesar, quem laudd, Cursor, whom 1
proice ego, qui eum laudo, J, who pratae bina Caesar et cicero, qul
md lar· iant, Occator and Cicero, ruho prorsa me.

a. rt is often necessary to translate a relative by a coniunctiori and
a personalor demonstrative pronoun (222, a). Example: relinquebatur
una via, qua ire ndn poterant, there was left only one way, aad by it they γ
could not ρο. Latin is fond of letting a relative stand at the beginning v
oi an entirely new sentence, with its antecedent in the preceding l
sentence. It is then usually best translated by apersonal or demon-
strative pronoun, without a conjunction. Example: caes. Ι, 27, 2.
