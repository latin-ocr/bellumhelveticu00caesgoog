LESSON l

’ ΙῚ. ΤΕΧΤ

The most important part oi the recitation period is that spent hythe
teaeher in preparing the alass ior studying the next day's lesson. Pronun-
eiation in particular must be learned almost wholly from the toacher, though
the pupil should be referred constantly to the Introduotory besson. Unless
the correct pronunciation oi eaoh word is firmly fixed in the student's mind
before he is allowed to study thelasson by himself, he will surely acquire
ineorreot habits ot pronunciation. A oorreet pronunciation is easily aequired
at the beginning. A few weeks ot carelessness will fix inoorreet habits

almost incurably.

Although the words below are divided into syllables it must be under-
stood that they are to be pronounoed smoothly as in English, with no breaks
between the syllables.

Gal-li-a: all vowels short; final a as iu Oubo; both l's sounded. est:
just as est in dioest3 the syllable is long (13), but this does not make the
vowel long (compare 3 and13). om‘·nis: om-, neither as in home nor as
in omnibus3 ο as the German short ο, nearly as oin for, not exaetly like any
English vowel ; i es in pia. ‹li-vistsa: dee-wee'·ao ; s as in aatd; a ae in
Gaba. in: as ia. par-tes: par· as in party, but with every clearly
sounded r ; -tes as taa- in toste. tres: as truce.
