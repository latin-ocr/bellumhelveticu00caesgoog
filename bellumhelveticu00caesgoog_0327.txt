258. In Latin, as in English, the condition and the conclusion are
usually oi the same form. But sometimes, in both languages, one may
wish to use a condition oi one form, a conclusion of another. Example:
si veniat hio adsumus, is he should come we arc ltere.

259. Instead of being expressed by a clause asin the examples given
above, the condition may be implied in a phrase or even in a single
word. Sometimes itis omitted altogether, but is supplied in thought. l
Examples: victus ad te veniam, (is) eoaquered I rhollcome to you; dicat,
hc worrld roy (if he should be asked); velim, I should like. The last two
are simply the independent subjunctive of contingent futurity (207).

260. Dum, modo, and dummodo are used with the subjunctive in 3
the sense oi is only, procidat thot. Notice that although these seem like
conditionsthe construction is not thesame, for the subjunctive is always
used, andthe negativo is often ne. This is because the construction
originally meant only let (himcomaI uilitate), and the mode is the sub·
iunctive oi desire (184, a). Examples: magno md metri liberabis dum·
modo murus intersit (Cic. (lat. 1,10), you ofili rid me of much fearif
only there bc (only let there be) o wall between aar modo ne (or non) discedat
eum videbo, if only he do not leave I shall ree him.
