7. There are 1ο silent letters iu Latin. Every word has as
many syllables as it has vowels or diphthongs. In English
1111113 111 syllable; in Latin 11111 13 two syllableS, 11111.

8. Α single consonant between two vowels goes with the
second vowel, as in me-ne.

9. When two consonauts stand together as 11 iste and inde,
the rule usually giren is: join both consonante with the iol-
lowing vowel if they can be prouounced together; otherwise
they should be dividcd. Sc, iste, inde But this rule is seldom
observed in practice, and is not theoretically right, since it makes
incomprehensible the length of syllables¹ The better rule is:
separate any combination of consonants except a mute followed
by a liquid (b, e, d, g, k, p, q, t, ch, ph, tn followed by l or r).
This is the natural pronunciation: iste and doe-tus are easier
then iste aud doctum 'but petrin is easier than patris

Ιο. Α doublcd consonantes 11 mitto aud annus, is to be
divided in the same way, mit-to aud 11-113, and both parts are
to be sounded. No doubled consonants are pronounced iu Eug-
lish except in compound words There is'no diffcrcnce 11 sound
between 1 aud 11 11 any and penny ; but in peu-luiso we hear
two n's The last example illustrates the way in which the
Romans pronounced 111 doubled consonauts.
