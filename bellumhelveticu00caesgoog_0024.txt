12. Α syllable is, of course, long if it contains a long vowel
or a diphthong. Such a syllable is said to be long by enotare.

13. Α syllable is long if its vowel is followed by any two eon-
sonants except a mute followed by aliquid. The reason for
this will bc clear if the student will compare the first syllables
in penny and penknrjfe. In penny we pronouuce only one n and
the syllable is short. In porctnzjfe it takes timeto pronounce
the n attha end of the first syllable before the following conso-
nant. This makes the syllable long. So it always takes time to
pronounce one consonant before another, except in the case of a
mute before aliquid. They run together so easily as to take no
appreciable time. Compare the sounds of uuo-tus and patris.
A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants
is said to he long by position.

14. Words of two syllables are accented on the first syllable.

So om'nis.

15. Words of more than two syllables are accented on the
penult (next to the last syllable) if it is long (by nature or hy
position); if the penult is short the acoent falls on the antepe-
nult (syllable before the penult). So divisa, appellan'tur, but
in'oolunt.

16. When an enclitic is joined to another word the accent

falls on the syllable ¹immediately preceding the enclitic. So
Gallia'que‚aod Gaul.
