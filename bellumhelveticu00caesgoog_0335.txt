'iti ¹ τ sersaoni · a 287-289

perfect active participle with a direct object can usually be translated
into Latin by putting the English object in the ablative and using the
passive participle in agreement with it (ablativa absolute, 150).
Examples: visus frigit, homey been acea he flat,- Caesare viso frigit, hamno
acea Ooaar lefled· literally‚ Caesar tanny teca acea lefled. See also 150.

a. But the perfect passive iorm oi deponent verbs usually (not
always) has an active meaning, so that with these verbs the change
described in 286 is not tc bemade. Example: Gaesarem conspicatus ,
frigit, iactrty seca Caeam he fied.

b. Besides the ordinary compound tenses oi the passive, the i
perfect participle is sometimes used with habeo. This emphasizes
the reaulting lact rather than the past act. Example: magnas copias
coegit, lie collected great forces· magnas copias coactas habuit, same
translation, but implies te had collected laryc forces aad still hod thera.

c. Note the translation oi such phrases as post urbem connium
after ae founding of tlte city; literally, oster the city founded.

GERUND AND GERUNDlVE

GERUND ·

287. ’Πιθ gerund is an active verbal noun and corresponds to the l
English verbal noun in -s'nq, except that it does not so commonly govem
a direct object (see 289). lt does regularly govern any other case that
is governed by the finite iormsoi the verb. Examples: higiendi causa ³
(99, a), for the sake offleetng ad persuadendum ei (115), sor persuading j
hira· urbem videndi eausa, for the sole of aceiae tte city. j

essunoivs l

288. The gerundivo is a passive adjective. In attributive (156) ¹
agreement with a noun it forms the so-called gerundive construction,
which is commonly used in place oi the gerund with a direct object.
(For its other uses see 285, Π.) In this construction the English direct ἵ
object takes the Latin case which the gerund would have, and the i
gerundive agrees with it. There is no exact English equivalent; the ,
translation is the sameas ior a gerund withadirect object. For example, 1
the gerund urbem videndi causa and the gerundive urbis videndae ,
causa (literally, for the sake os the city to be acea) both mean for the sake ο] t
seeiaytlw city.
