ott. lt has already been learned that. the accusative and infinitivo construc-
uou must be used aiter verbs ol sapias or thinking. Now wlreuever “ he says '¹
or ‘¹ he thinks '' is used with au object clause, some one's words or thoughts ³
are being quoted. This may be douc iu two ways: lte says “l will come,''
or le says that lc will conte. Iu tlre lormer sentence the man's exact wonls
are used; that is, he is quoted dirceus, or in direct discours& in the latter
the substance oi what he says is given, not in his exact words, but with a ¹
change of constructi0u; that is, he is quoted indirecta, or in indirect dar-
course. If the student has thoroughly understood what has been said about
the tenses of the infinitiva, be has mastered the chief difficulty oi indirect
discourse. When an English sentence is to be put into Latin, stop and
think what the original words ol the quoted sentence must have been.
Tlren use the tense cl the infinitiva tlrat correspouds to the original tense
used by the speaker, and it will be right. For example, in lte said that
lte was ricla, the original words urust lrave been l aaa ricla ; so the present
inlinitive is right. ln lte sold thal be bod been rich, the original words
might have been 1 bave been (Latin perlecti ricla, l was (Latin perfect) rich.
or 1 was (Latin imperfect) rich. All these are past in time and the perfect
infinitive is the only past infinltlve, scitis right. lu lte said that lte would
be rich, the original words were Ι shall be rich, and the future infinitiva is
right.

5¹2. One other thing must be remembered. Wherever the original
speaker used a personal or possessive pronoun oi the first person (that is,
when lic said 1, wc, aa, my, 'orta etc.) the indirect discourse uses some form
oi sul or suun lor the other persons, it uses some form of le or some other
demonstrative. For example, il hosapa tltat lte ia ricla stands for 1 cm
rich, ιδ esse must be used3 it it stands for lte is ricla eum esse.
