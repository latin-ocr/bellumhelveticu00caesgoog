The passus consisted oi five pedes, and was therefore about 4 feet and 10
inches in length. The passus was the measure of the stride made from the
place where the loot is lifted to the point where the same ioot is again put
down. As no English measure represents its length, the Roman term may

be used in translating or pace may be used, remembering that it is really
a double pace. The Roman mile (mille pascuum) consisted of one
thousand parisiis.

253. In order to explain why he had to flght with the Helvetians Caesar
begins his narrative by telling of things that happened about three years
before he went to Gaul. Although the Gauls were a partially civilized peo-
ple, having walled towns, made, and bridges‚ they were not yet settled
enough to have forgotten the habits of their ancestors‚ who had wandered
about in vast bordes with their wives and children and all their property,
ravaging the country and settling where they liked. This chapter and a few
which follow tell how the Helvetians decided to renew this old habit.

1. Write a good English translation oi Chap. II. (p. 233). Beware of
“translation English.'’ That is, do not use words or arrangements of words
which are horrowed from the Latin and which would nothe used ordinarily
in writing English. Do not make men always “wago war‚” instead of
“light'’ Do not say “Messala being consul,” instead of “in the consul-
ship of,'¹ etc.

II. Review the vocabularies ln121 and168.
