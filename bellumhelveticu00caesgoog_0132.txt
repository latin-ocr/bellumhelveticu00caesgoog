ΡΑΗΤΙΟΙΡΕΕΒ

- 396. There are three participles in Latin;-a present active, as lau·
dans, proiciam a future active, as laudaturus, about to praise5 and a
perfect passive, as laudatus, tactae been meaa. Notice that this makes
no provision for the English form taviop praised. Latin has no perfect
active participle, except of course in deponent verbs, where the perfect pas-
sive form has an active meaning, so that conitus means tactae attempted.

397. The present active participle is formed by adding -ns, or -dns to
the present stem. Example: lauda-÷ns‚1audens‚prctstaa; audi-ssus,
audiens, lacenae. Deponent verbs have this form, though it is active.
For declension see App. ³8.

398. The future active participle is formed by adding -lfrus to the su-
pine stem. Examples: laudat-i-ssrus, laudaturus, canopaea dlvfs·
idrus, dirivemus, about to divide. Deponcnt verbs have this form als0.
It is declined like magnus.

For the perfect passive participle see ³16.
