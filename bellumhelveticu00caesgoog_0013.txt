ciation. This may not be deemed advisable by all teachers3 but
it is urged, as essential to entire thoroughness, that the student

Ι become so familiar with the text that he can give the English

‚ior the Latin or the Latinior the English when pronounced hy
the toacher. The text of the twenty-nine chapters, given con-
nectedly after the hessone, will be found convenient for reviews.

Second: Immediately aiter the text of each lesson, the mean·

ing of the Latin words, as they occur in the order oi the text, is
given in English, and the student should be required to give both
the English equivalent for the Latin and the Latinior the Eng-
lish as pronounced hythe teacher. Each vocabulary contains an
entirely new set of words. It is expected that the pupil will
thoroughly master the words of each lescen, so that he will
recognize them as they occur again and again in the text. This
saves the time of the student - often wasted in repeatedly look-
ing up the same word— strengthens the memory, cultivates the
attention, and secures accurate knowledge. The general vocabu-
lary at the end of the book should be unnecessary, except, per-
haps, for words ¹which rarely occur.
, Third : For the convenience oi teachers, and to give definite
direction to the studente work, the substance of the text is given
in short porticus in dictation exercises‚ which the student is to
be required to translate orally as pronounced by the teacher.
This gives opportunity to vary forms and constructione, fixes the
meaning of words, and insures familiarity with the text. The
matter given in these exercises can easily be modified and 'ex-
tended at tlalcasure of the instructor.

Foarth: The same text is used as the basis for English
sentences ri> ee written in nasis. werre ua thought of ee
passage is often retained in these sentences, their structure is so
varied from the original as to afford thorough grammatical drill.
Nc new words are introduced in this exercise, that no time may
be lost in looking them up. This abundant practice, with
Caesarean models fresh in the mind of the student, produces
readiness in Latin composition and a correct style.
