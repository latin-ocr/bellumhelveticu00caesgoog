7, 8. qui . . . perfugissent, who had flod. The relative clause quotes
the words of Caesar’s demand in indirect discourse. He said “the slaves
who have fied.” As the idea of sayingis only implied, 'this is called implied
indirectdisoourse. See App. 273. dum . . . cdnferuntur, while these
were ὁσίης sospiti out aad broupltt roperta. Dum, while, is used with the
present indicative in referring to past events and must be translated by the
imperfect indicative. Ea is used inclusively for obsides, arma, servas.
The masculine ei might have been used. Such a pronoun follows the same
rule as that given for predicate adjectives. See App. 157, α, 2.

9. Verbigenus: see App. 126, α.

10. timore ne tp tire seur that. For translation of ne see on Chap.
XIx.,11.
