exercises both in an exereise book and on the blackboard should
be required throughout all the lessons. 'she shorter Latin-
English exercises should be translated at hearing as the teacher
pronounces the words.

4. The principles and facts ol the notes should be thoroughly
learned and recited. Although frequent references are made to
the same principle, it should not be necessary for the student
to occupy histirne in turning to the first explanation.

5. Drill thoroughly and constantly on the paradigms. Do
not be satisfied until the student can run through them as rapidly
as he can the alphabet. The student finds translation more
interesting, and sees that it is possible to translate short bits of
Latin with the help of the vocabulary, and without much knowl- y

edge of paradigma If for any reason the teacher allows him to r

6. In translating, the student should be taught to ascertain

board one word at a time, calling upon the student to give the
meaning, word by word, as the sentence progresses. Here the
student should be taught to think of the possible constructions
of each word and to anticipato the following words, and yet
