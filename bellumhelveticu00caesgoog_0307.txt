correspondstoall the forms of the English present. Example: laudat,

a. The historical present speaks of a past fact as if it were present,
in order to put it vividly before the mind. It is much more common in
Latin than in English, and, therefore, should usually be translated bya
past. Example: oppida sua omnia incendunt (Caes. Ι, 5, 4), they
turned (burn) all their towns. ‘

b. With such expressions as iam dic, iam pridem, for a lrmp lime,
multos annos, for many prora, the Latin present is to be translated by
the English perfect. Example: multos anndstemoned, I have been

the past'’ and “I still am.'’ English expresses one ol them; Latin, like
French and German, expresses the other.
