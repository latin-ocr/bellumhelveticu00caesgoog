may be regarded as a coniunctiori, but is really an ablativa ol measure oi

difference. Example: venit quo facilius videret, be concibat be might ξ

aee more easily, literally by whr'sh the more ready he might see.

3. Otherwise, and most commonly, the conjunctiora ut is used. 3

Exempla: venit ut videret, he conte to see, that he might aee, or a'n order to
aea ,venit ut videat, becomes to ree. ·

b. In negative clauses the conjunctior] ns is always used Example:

boc fecit ne quis videret (not ut nemo), aa ata thia thot no orte minist res, ἵ

or to keep aanorw from saetas.

RESULT CLAUSES

226. Result is expressed in Latin by the subjunctive with ut (affir-
mative) or ut non (negative). The subjunctive is sometimes one oi con·
tingant futurity (184, b), tobetranslated bywould, etc, or, more freely, so
os to (tendency rather than resultj; but usually it is the subjunctive oi
fact (184, c), to be translated hythe indicative. Notice that the imper-
iect subjunctive in this construction must usually be translated by the
perfect indicative. But see 204, a, at end. For the eocalled relative
clause ol result see 230. For the substantive clause oi result see 229.
Examples: mons impendebat, ut perpauci prohibere possent (Caes.
I, 6, 5), omoantain ovahuay, ao thot every few could easily clrecln incredibili
lenitate, ita ut iddicari ndu possit (Caes. Ι, 12. 3), of extraordinary
alayyishnesa, so that a con not be determiaed· tam fortis est ut pdgnet, heia
so breve thot he would fiyht, or os to fiyht, or that be fiyhts.

SUBSTANTWE ernusfis ΟΡ assiae ΑΝΟ ΟΡ assui]

227. These clauses differ from clauses of purpose and result in that
they are used like noune, either as the object oi a transitive verb, or as
the subject oi the passive, or in apposition with a noun or neuter pronoun.
There is the same difference between the two substantive clauses as
between clauses ol purpose and those ol result, and they are to be
distinguished in the same way (224).

substantive clauses ΟΡ aestas (PURPOSE) ⁴

228. Although these clauses are usually called substantive clauses ol
purpose, they do not really express purpose but are expressions oi will
or wish used as objecta, ete, ol verbs For example: imperf> ut eas,
Ι οοηυηιιιιά you io qo, does not mean I command in order that you may oo,
but rather I pire the command, “90’'· 'rhis ρο would be expressed by the
imperative in an independent sentencejl85) but must be the subjunctive
ol desire in the dependent clause. The choice ol a conjunction depende
upon the nieaning ol tbe principal verb.
