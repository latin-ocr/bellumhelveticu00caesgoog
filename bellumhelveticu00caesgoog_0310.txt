ll 201-203 APPENDIX ³305

commanded thot lie protae, is a past command to praise in a time future to
the past, though it may be now really past. The perfect subjunctive in
this nse is often nearly the same as the present subjunctive, though not
so often used.

201. The following table shows the meanings of the subjunctive
tenses.

Present = present or future

Imperfeot = imperfect or future to a past .
Perfect = perfector future perfect (or future)
Pluperfect = pluperfect or future perfect to a past

o. Some of these tenses have developed special meanings in certain
constructions. See 221. 226, and 254.

b. Since the present has a future meaning as well as a present, and
the perfect has a future perfect meaning as well as a perfect, the sub-
junctive needs no special forms for the future and future perfect. But
where the meaning would be doubtful and it is necessary to express the
futureclearly, the periphrastic tenses are used.

202. When a subjunctive clause depends on some other clause, a
little thinking about the real meaning of the English will enable oue to
use the right tense, just as in the indicative. When the tenses mean
the same as those of the indicative they will be used in the same way
(197‚1es). When they have the future set of meanings, it will bc
found that a present or perfect is usually required altera tense of
present or future meaning, and the imperfect and pluperfect after one of
past meaning. For example: I coare, or I shall come, thol I ancy protae,
laudem3 I conae thot Ι might proice, lsuddrem. Iu tho subjunctive the
usage ismore regular than in the indicative, so that the convenient but
not very accurate rule, called the rule of sequence of tenses, can be
followed.

Rule: In dependent subjunctive clauses principal tenses follou
principal, and historical follow historical.

20³. Principal tenses are those which have to do with the present
and future, historical are those which have to do with the past. The
following table of examples shows which arethe principal and which
the historical tonsus of both indicative aud subjunctivo.
