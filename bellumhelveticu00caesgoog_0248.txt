APPENDIX

lNTRODUCTlON

The appendix, in its present form, is notan enlargement of the former
one, but has been written independently. Itis intended primarily to
gather intoa systematis whole the grammatical notes given in the lessons,
and to supplement thern; and it is furthermore intended to include all
the grammatical material which need be put into the hands of a Caesar ·
or Cicero class. 'Phe regular paradigms are given in full, with only such
exceptional forms as are needed ior the reading oi Caesar and Cicero.
1 t is believed that the treatment oi syntax covers all the essential usages ἢ
of those authors, and that the relatively large arnount oi explanation is
given only where it is needed. Rules are almost invariably stated in
full, so that when the student takes up a more complete grammar he
will have to master only the exceptione, not the principles.

The examples are in part made up, for the sake ci brevity and clear·
ness, but are drawn largely from Caesar and Cicero. References to
Caesar are made by book, chapter, and line oi the chapter as nearly
as the varying editions will permit. References to Cicero are made by
oration and section.

The writer has consulted the usual authorities and ¹is under special
obligatione, as regards the treatment of the verb, to the writings and
personal instruction oi Professor William Gardner Hele. The present
treatment oi the verb is by no means in full accord with Professor Hale’s,

yet it is largely influenced by it.
