188. There are two kinds oi negatives'in Latin.

a. non, aot, and neque, aad aot, nor, are used everywhere except in
expressions oi will or wish; that is, they are used with the indicative,

infinitivo. Examples: ndn laudat, lte does aot proba· ndn laudet, lu J -

meanings which express will or wish; that is, with the subiunctive oi

the time oithe action, whether past, present, or future; and (2) the
stage oi progress oi the action at that time, whether already completed,

, still going on, or about to take place. For example, the following forms
are all past, and yet express different things; lauddvit, beproiseol simply
puts the action in the past ; laudaverat, be hod praised, means that the
action was already completed in the past time ; laudabat, bewosproiaing,
means that the action was going on in the past time; and lauditfirus
eret, he uae poiaq to praba, means that in the past time the action was
on the point of taking place. Latin is much more accurate in its use
ostensos than English is, and it is important to understand exactly
what each of its tenses means.
