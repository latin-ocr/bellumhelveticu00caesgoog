LESSON XIV

GENDER

107. English nouns have only natural geiider. Names 31 males are mas·
culina, 3113133133, feminine; 31 things without life, neuter. But in Latin,
as in French and German, there is a yrnvnmatical gender. Here too names
31 males are masculine and names 31 iemalcs feminine ; but othernouns are
masculine, feminine, or neuter, with no apparent reason ior the choico.
Thus agenfield, is masculine; terra, land, feminine3 solum, soil, neuter.
lt is absolutely necessary to know the gender 31 every 3333. Τ33 nomina-
tive form will tell the gender 31 very many nouns; a few general ruleS,
given in App. 13, will help about some othere, but ior the rest memory
must be depended upon.

that Latin adjectivae are declined and have special forms to show the gender
