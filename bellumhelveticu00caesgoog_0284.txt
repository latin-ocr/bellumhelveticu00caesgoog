SYNTAX

SENTENCES

88. A sentence is a group ol words so related as to express a thought.
It consiste oi at least two parte-the subject (that ol which something
is said), and the predicate (that which is said about the subject). These
two essential partsmaybe modified in various ways. A sentence may
consist of a single verb, because the subject is implied in its ending.

89. A Simple sentence has one subject and one predicate and ex-
presses one thought; as (laesor venit, Caesar come.

90. A compound Sentence consiste of two or more simple sentences
connected in some way. Each sentence is calleda clause.

α. If the 'clauses are connected by conjunctions with such meanings
as aad, bat, scr, or, they are equally independent and are called coor-
dinate clauses. Exemplo: (laeter venit et Galli fdgenmt, Gener
come aad the Gaulo sled.

b Ii the clauses are connected by coniunctione with such meanings
as in order thot, ao that, is, because, although, when, after, before, the
clause containing the conjunction is dependent on the other and is
called a dependent (subordinate) clause; the other is called an indepen-
dent (main) clause. Example: ubi caesar venit Galli fugerunt,
when Caesar caete tlte Gaulaflcd.

c. Some teachers restrict the name compound to euch sentencesas
those described above in o, and give the name complex to those that
have a dependent clause.

91. Sentences are declarativa, interrogative, imperative, orexclama-
tory, as in English.
