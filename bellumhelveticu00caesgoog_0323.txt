c. Inverled clausa ahere are found in sentences which contain an
eventandasituationandwhich are morenaturallyexpressedasin 242, a.
Sometimes that natural order oi expression is inverted, so that the
situation is expressed in the principal clause (by an imperfect orplu·
perfect indicative), and the event in the cum clausa (by a perfect or
historical present indicative). Example: summus mons a Labieno
tenebatur, cum Considius accurrit (compare 242, a, example), ibe top
os the mountain cuna in llic maceston os habimus, wbm up rode Gratidius.

242. Subjunctive Glauses. The subjunctive is used with temporal
cum in the following clauses:

o. Sduation and naeniae donea. A situation clause describes the
situation (condition of things, accompanying circumstances) under which
an event took place, the event being told inthe principal clause. It
conesponds, in some degree, to a characterizing relative clause (230).
Such a clause almost invariably tells a new point in tho narrative, and
may therefore be called a narrative clause. situation and narrative
clauses ars thus the same thing, but sometimes the one or the other
name seems more applicable. In writing latin, if it seems doubtful
whether a clause belongs hem or under 241, α, it almost certainly be·
longe here. (The causal and adversative clauses [239] gmw out of this
clause, because almost every clause which describes the situation gives
a reason for [causal] oragainst [adversative] the main event.) Example:
cum summus mons ἃ Labieno teneratur, neque adveatm cognitus
esset, cousidius accurrit (Caes. I, 22,1), when 1111 top os rte mountain was
in ibe 1111111εεί011 of habimus, und bia approach had aot been noticcd, Considiae
rode up.

b. Generalis-inp danea. The generalizing clause (241, b) is sometimes
inthe subjunctive. Example: cum ferrum se inflexisset, aequaevel-
lere.... poterantfflaeal, 25,8), when the ironpoimbodbentfineach
of many cases), it could neither be drawn out, etc.
