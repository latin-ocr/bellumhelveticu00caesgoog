270. The tenses of the subjunctive have the same meanings and
follow the same rule in indirect discourse as elsewhere (aco-204). The ’
quotation depends on the verb of scytae or thiatirae and is in primary
sequence if that verb is primary, secondary if it is secondary.

a. But after a past verb of ccyinp or tliclicp the quoter very often
drops the secondary sequence and uses the tenses of the original speaker,
for the sake of vividness. Exempla: respondit: . . . cum ea ita sint
...sese pacem esse facturum (Caes. Ι, 14, 17), he replied. . . thal
allbodph these lbicps are so be will melre peace.

b. After a perfect infinitive the secondary sequence must be used
even if the infinitive depende on a primary verb of saying or thinking;
for the perfect infinitive is past, even though it depende on a present.
Example: dicit caesarem laudatum essequod fortis esset, he seps
rtur Caesen was praised became lze was brace. (Notice that the English is

acas, not is.)

c. Iu changing from the direct form to a subjunctive of the indirect
the following rule is helpful; keep the stem of the original and follow
the sequence. So for example a present or future indicative becomes
present subjunctive after dicit, imperfect after dixit, in either case re·
taining the present stem ; a perfector future perfect indicative becomes
perfect subjunctive after dicit, pluperfect after dixit, in either case re·
taining the perfect stem. ’

Other Clacpes

271. If a pronoun of the first person changes to one of the third
person it must be to some form of sui or suus (rarely of ipse). All other
changes of person or proncuns arethe same ss in English. Example:
hunc militem laudo, Ι prcr’se llis soldier, may become dico me huno
militem laudare, Ι say lbet I proice llis soldier, or dicit se illum militem
laudare, he says that be merses thet soldier. Adverbs will be changed in
the same way, που) to then, ltere to llere, etc. Vocatives will become
nominatives or disappear.

Condllr'cns in Indirect Discoccrse

272. Ι. Th'e condition, since it is the dependent clause, must have
its verb in the subjunctive. The tense follows the rule of sequence
except that the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive of conditione con-
trary to fact never change, even after a primary tense.

Π. The conclusion, since it is the principal clause, must have its
