audiens sum, otey, and fidem habore, iuret. Exempla: oui fldem
habebat (Caes. 1, 19, 16), whom be seuseu.

h. Many oi these verbs which are ordinarilyintransitive occasionally

take an accusative of the thing, usually a neuter pronoun. Examples: ,

provinciae militum numerum imperat (Caes. Ι, 7,·4), ha turbe o number
of soldicrs ou the provinca id eis persuasit (Caes. Ι, 2, 7), lu persuaded
thern to this (literally he persuaded rtis to theru).

e. Not all verbs with the meanings given above govern the dative.
The most important exceptione are the transitive verbs delecto, dettqht,
iubeo, cornmoud, iuvo, plesse, veto,sorbtcl. Example: Labienum iubet
(Caes. Ι, 21, 5), he omumouds munus.

d. Since only the direct object oi the active voice becomes the subiect
oi the passive (124, b), no intransitive verb can have a personal subiect
in the passive. The verbs oi 116 can be used in the passive only
impersonally, and the dative is retained, though it is usually translated
as a subiect. Examples: caesarem laudo (transitive), I protae Onetor,
becomes Caesar laudatur, Ooeeor ta praised· but Caesari persuadeo
(intransitive), I persuade Coesor, becomes <lassari persuadetur, Caesaris
perutudcd (literally itis persuaded to Cacsar).

116. une Indirect object with compound verbs. 1. Certain

propositione usually give to verbs with which they are compoundcd a ,

meaning which, in Latin idiom, requires the dative. If the uncom·
pounded verb is transitive the compound governs a direct object in
addition to the indirect. The dative is variously translated with these
verbs: when it is translated by from, the dative is sometimes called the
dative oi separation. ,

The dative is required with most compounds oi ad, ante, oon (= cum),
de, in, inter, ob, post, prae, pro, sub, and super-3 and with some corn-
poundsoiab,cireum,and ex. Examples: cumomnibus praestarent
· (Caes. Ι, 2, 5), siam they excelledoll; finitimis bellum inferre (Caes. Ι, 2,
13), tomobe soor upou their rretphbors,¹ munitioni Labienum praeficit
(Caes. I, 10, 8), bo puta Labienus tu command os the worda· scdtd militi ¹
deuecta (Caes. ΙΙ, 25, 14), hociup saotched o elruldfrom oaoldc‘er.

11. The dative is used with compounds oisatisand bene. Example:
si Aeduis satisfaciant (Caes. Ι, 14, 19), r'f'they should mulce reatduttou to
the Aedui.

o. The meaning of the compound does not always permit the
dative. Among the most important exceptions are the transitive verbs,
aggredior, abach· incendo, burru interficio, lu'll; oppugno, ustauh but
