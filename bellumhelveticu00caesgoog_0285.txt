280 ' APPENDIX Ξέ93-95

by the order oi words or by the use oi prepositions; yet the socalled
possessive case illustratas the use oi the Latin cases, ior the ending 's
in thesoldier’scrms indicates that soldier modifies arens and that the
soldier is the possessor oi the arms. But in the English sentences ¹tlte
soldier (subject) figitis, lze lcills the soldier (direct object), lte pices the aleier
(indirect object) a accord, only the order oi words shows the relation oi

the wordtothe rest oi the sentenoe; while in Latin miles wouldbe ’

used in the first sentence, militem in the second, and militi in the
third.

93. But each oi the cases (except the vocative) expresses more than
one thing. Consequentlyone must know just what uses each casecan have,
and mustthen determine which one oi these uses it has inthe sentencein
which it occurs. This can be determined sometimes by the meaning oi
the word itseli, sometimes hythe obvious meaning oi the sentence,
sometimes by the iact that another word needs a certain case to satisiy
its meaning and that case appears but once in the sentence. Examples:
the accusative may express duration oi time, but militem, accidier,
could not be used in this sense, while multos annos, marry years, is quite
probably eo used. Dicit pilum militem vulneravisse might mean
either he says thul o jor-elin eounded the soldier, or asoldier wwnded ille
jocelin, but the latter makes no sense. Persuasit, he persuaded, needs

a dative to express the person persuaded, and ii there is but one dative
in the sentence its use is evident. ’

94. For further clearness many relations are expressed· in Latin by
prepositions, though not so many as in English. Examples: a milite

interfectus est, leuas killed by a soldier,· cum mllite venit, he came ia χ

company esst a soldier.
