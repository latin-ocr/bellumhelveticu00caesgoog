2³5. Coniunctions meaning *rodii show that the action oithe principa] i
clause lasted up to that of the subordinate clause. The action oi the
subordinate clause is therefore subsequent to that oi the principal clause.
Sometimes the actor in the principal clause ioresees the second act and
intends to bring it about, or prepares ior it, and sometimes he does not.
This is the basis for the distinction in the uso oi modes.

u. Dum, donec, and quoad, uohl, are used with the indicative when ¹
the subordinate aet is not represented as foreseen. The perfect is

regularly used ior past time. Exempla: Galli fuenmt liberi dum
Caesar vdnit, the Geruli rcere free cohi Caesar curre.

ulline.

b. The same conjunctions are used with the subjunctive when the
subordinate act is represented as foreseen. Exempla: Galli magnas
copias comparare conati sunt priusquam caesar veniret, the Garis
tried to prepare ierpe ferere before Caesar should errice, or arrived.

e. These conjunctione are often written as two words, the prius or
ante-standing in the principa] clause, and the quam at the beginning ol

quam dces. Example: Galli prius inter sd prignaverunt quam
caesar venit, translated as in e.
