verb in the infinitiva. Indicative tenses change to infinitiva tenses
according to 266, a.' The present and perfect subjunctive of less confi-
dent future conclusione become the future infinitive, in -ssrus esse. The
imperiect and pluperfect of conclusione contrary to fact becomes an in-
finitive not elsewhere used, in-r'rrus fuisss; but the imperfect sometimes
becomes the future infinitive, in -s'srus esse.

Examples are needed for only the conditione contrary to fact, since
all others follow the regular rules oi sequence and indirect discourse.
Si pugnaret eum laudarem, is he were fightiap I should moise him, be
comes, after either dicit or dixit, si pugnaret se sum laudaturum
husee (or esse); si pugnavisset eum laudavissem, ifle hod foughtl

tation even ii there is no verb of saying or thinking. The verb of that
subordinate clause must be a subjunctive. This is especiallycommouin
clauses depending on purpose clauses or substantive clauses oi purpose,
and is more common in Cicero than in Caesar. Examples: Sulpicium misi
qui, siquid teldrum esset, efferret (Cic. Cat. III, 8), I seat Sulpicius lo
bring out wholcuer weopoas there were the original words were bring out
whatever weopons there arc (est): ut saluti provideretis, cum maleficium
viddretis (Cic. Cat. ΙΙΙ, 4), thal you miphl look out for sofety when you should
sec lhc evil· not to he mistaken lor the ordinary subjunctive with cum;
the original thought was tluy shall lacteat for easety when they shall sec
(videbunt). See also 244.

274. Sometimes a verb that would otherwise stand in the indicative
is put in the subjunctive only because it depende on another subjunctive
or on an infinitive. This is called attraction. Example: essent (Caes.
I, 27, 5), a determining clause (231).
