tanin-nnentsn nomentana

Iu this vocabulary the declension ol nouus is indicated by the
ending oi the genitive. The figures l, 2, and 4, after verbs, indicate
that the principal parts are iormed like those oi leudo, moneo, and
audio, respectively. Ii the principal parts are otherwise formed they
are given in lull. The supine in -um is given as the fourth form,
although the nominative singular masculine oi the perfect passive parti·
ciple is now more commonly given. It is true that the supine ol many
verbs is not found in extant literature; but the nominative masculine oi
the perfect passive participle irom intransitive verbs (e. g. ventus) is
not even theoretically possible. Furthermore, there seems to be no
justification ior including a passive torm among tlre active principal

parts.
