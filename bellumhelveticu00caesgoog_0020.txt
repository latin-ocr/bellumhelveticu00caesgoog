ment they met at the southern point of Lake Genera. There
they assembled in the spring of 58 ac, to the number of three
hundred and sixtyeight thousand, of whom ninety·two thousand
were men-atarms. Under modern civilization the same country
now supports a population of two milliens eight hundred and
fifty thousand.

At Lake Genava the Helvetii found their advance opposed by
Caesar. Their most natural course was to cross the Rhene, pass-
ing through a corner of the Roman province in southeastern
Gaul. They sent a deputation asking permission to pass through
the province without damage. To gain time, Caesar put them
off to a second conference, spent the interval in constructinga
line of fortifications along the Rhene, and then formally forbade
their passage.

After vainly epdeavoring to force a'passage of the Rhone, the
Helvetii, by arrangement with the Sequani, their neighbors on
the northwest, proceeded to cross the Saone instead of the Rhene
and thence to march westward. Caesar added five fresh legions
to the one already athis disposal, and after about three-fourths
of the Helvetian troops had crossed the Saone, fell upon and cut
to pieres the remainder. Efferts on the part of the Helvetii to
procure terms of peace satisfactory to themselves proved anavail·
ing, and after some minor contests the final decisive battle was
fought at the Aeduan town, Bibracte, now Autun. Caesar ac-
knowledges that the battle was closely contested and for a long
time doubtful, but in the end Roman arms and discipline won
a victory that ended all the hopes of the Helvetii. At the eom-

mand of Caesar they returned to their desolated homes, but with
the loss of more than two-thirds of their entire number. Remains

of skeletons, ornaments, and arms have been unearthed on the*
field of the great battle near Autun.
