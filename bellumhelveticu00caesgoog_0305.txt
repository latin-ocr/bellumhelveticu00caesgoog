182. The latin verb has three modes- the indicative, the subjunc-
tive, andthe imperative. The name mode is applied to them because
they indicate the manner in which the action oi the verb is spoken os;
for example, as a certainty or as willed.

183. The Indicotive speaks oi the action as certain, either stating
afact or asking a question about a lact. Examples: laudat, ive pratee,-
udn laudat, lte does not pratee· laudatus? docete preire?

184. The Subjunctive has three classes oi meanings, some oi which
may be iurther subdi vided.

c. The Subjunctire os Desire. Both in independent sentences and
in dependent clauses the subjunctive may express will (then called
volitive) or wish (then called optative). Examples: laudet, lettim
preire or may lte proies· impero ut laudet, I command thot he moise, i. e,
Ι pice tlte command “let him proice.’'

b. rte subjunctive os Contirwem Μανίῳ. Both in independent seu·
tences and in dependent clauses the subjunctive may express what
would take place under some condition, either expressed or implied, or,
very seldom, it may express what may possibly take place. The latter
use is the potential. Examples: laudet, lte reonldprar‘se (ii there should
be reason); is est qui laudet, heis a nean who would preire.

c. Tite Sulp‘unctive os Fcet. Only in dependent clauses the subiunct-
ive may express certainty and be translated just like the indicative.
These uses oi the subjunctive are the most difficult to understand aud
member, because there seems to be uo reason tor usingthe subiunctive
