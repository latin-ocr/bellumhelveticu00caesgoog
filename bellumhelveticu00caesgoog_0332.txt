accustorned, attempt, hepta, ceute, determine, cupiit, atah„ and the like. Some
oi these verbs are intransitive ;· with others the infinitive may be regarded
as taking the place of a direct object. Examples: ire potest, he cort po;
ire potuit, hc could hore pone, literaily he uiua able ιο pu· constituerunt
comparare (Caes. Ι, 3, 2), they determinat ιο prepare.

a. As these verbs have no subject accusative, either expressed or
understood, a predicate noun or adjective must agree with the nomina·

used as the subject of such impersonal verbs as decet, libet, licet,
oportet, placet, and oi estin such expressionsas necesse eet, satie est.
(The infinitivo with these verbs often has an expressed accusative sub·
ieet. See 278.) Examples: ire oportet, orre must po, literally ιο poia rophe
ire oportuit, one oupht ιο hove porte (205, a), literally ιο 9⁰ was apht- ei
ire licuit, he mipht hare porte, literally ιο po roua perrnittcd ιο him.

tives, and a predicate noun or adjective is regularly in the accusative.
But licet governs the dative and the predicate is usually dative.
Examples: sortem esee oportet, occ cupit ιο temeravit& licet esee forti,
a marr rnuy be braca literally tris permitted ιο ο marc ιο bc broce
