LESSON xxiii

l68. nevisw

Ι. Recita and translate the entire text of the first chapter.

This chapter is the general geographical introduction to Caesar’s narra
tive of his extraordinary campaigns in Gaul. Such a chapter was especially
necessary at the time he wrote, because the Romans then knew almost noto-
ing of the geography oi Gaul, except the parts nearest to Italy and the
Mediterranean. Gaul was to them only a vast unknown country whose
inhabitants had once taken and sacked Rome, and had several times de-
feated Roman armies with iearlul slaughter. Il the student has not yet
mastered the generaloutlines oi its geography he should do so now with the
aid ol this chapter and the map on page 26. Note especially the position of
the Helvetians and what Caesar has to say ol the1n; for it is with them that
the narrative is now most concerned. Rearl pages 12 and 13.

ΙΙ. Review the vocabularies in 87 and 121.
