regarded as still attainable, is expressed by the present subjunctive, less
often bythe perfect. Example: utinam tibi istam mentem di duint
(Cic. Cat. Ι, 22) Othat (Ι hope that) the goda moy give you that purpose!

b. A wish for something at the present time is expressed by the im·
perfect subjunctive (compare the English were). A wish for something
. in the past is expressed hythe pluperfect subjunctive (compare the
English hod). Both of these express a wish, or rather a regret‚ for
something nnattainable. Utinam is always used. Examples: utinam
adesset! would that (I aciat thot) he were here! utinam omnis copisa
eduxisset (Cic. Cat. ΙΙ, 4), would that (1 wat tltol) be had taken all casarea!
